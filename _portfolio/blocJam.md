The Bloc Jams music app is a project that I worked on while a student attending Bloc. The goal of the project is to make a fully functional music player while strengthening my skills using HTML, Javascript, NodeJS and Angular.  

This project is rooted in HTML and begins like many others. I was challenged to setup the basics of the web pages that were needed for this project, this included using cascading style sheets. Each of the pages were designed and setup to be mobile responsive to make them more easily viewed on a mobile device. I used pseudo-classes such as hover and active on the navigation links and other links on the site.

A fun challenge during this project was learning about the Document Object Model and traversing the DOM. By being able to select a specific class or element in the DOM, I was able to manipulate and animate that element. After adding an event listener to my code, I was able to have bullet points appear only once your scrolled down on the page.

Since this is a site to play music and we want to be able to see the albums available to listen to and the songs on those albums. Initially, I donâ€™t need to have all of the albums and songs, I only need space holders to use for formatting and fillers. I was able to use a for loop to loop an album template of information so my page and begin to take shape. These songs later can be pulled from a database using my template to format them all the same. Once you click on the specific album you want to see more information on, the album will open with all of the additional album information and pull a list of songs from a songs array. The ability to play and pause a song as well as change the song was completed by using Javascript and jQuery.  

This was a fun project geared towards learning the fundamentals of web development. I will always look back on and remember the struggles and bask in the joy of overcoming them.
