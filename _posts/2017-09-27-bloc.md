### Experience with Bloc

So far my experience with Bloc has been pretty good. The mentors all seem to have their own style and something unique to offer. It is a challenge selecting one and hoping that their style fits with your own.

I don’t find that I bug the mentor too much out of my weekly meeting. Some of that is probably just me trying to figure things out and not wanting and the other is I am just moving along at a snails pace. Bloc offers a couple of different paces to keep you moving. Having a large family and a full time job, I find myself struggling to keep up with the slowest pace. This isn’t a nock on Bloc or even myself, it is just a observation that I am all and all an extremely busy person.

I love learning new languages and challenge of web development. **I am eager to continue making progress with Bloc and become a full-time web developer!**
