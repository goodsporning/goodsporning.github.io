title: The Challenge!
---

I chose to name this blog the challenge, but it should almost more fittingly be named challenge accepted! I wanted to take a couple of minutes to share my experiencing and challenges while learning to develop and code. As most of your know by now, I chose to attend Bloc to help me along my path of learning and accepting challenges. The program has been wonderful so far and I know that if I ever get stuck, my mentor is right around the corner to help me.

Surprisingly, learning all of the different languages hasn’t even been by biggest challenge yet. Don’t get me wrong, it has definitely been a lot of work putting together the pieces to make a program or section of code work, but time management has been my biggest challenge thus far. I am sure someone somewhere thought “Time management” this guy is nuts! Get real!

You would be surprised how much you can actually squeeze into a day. A little background on me, I work full time running the support department for a software company. My typical work day runs from 8am - 6pm Monday through Friday with the occasional Saturday. I have an hour commute each way before and after work. When I am not in the office, I am typically on call should something go down or account calls me in need. At home, I am happily married with four kids under six and a happy go lucky golden retriever. All of the above need to get their Daddy time in, which I do love and wouldn’t change for the world. Once I can get the kids down for bed is when I am able to spend time to actually learn. I have found that committing the time and scheduling my time to do each tasks helps me keep on top of everything. It prevents me from getting distracted and watching that Monday Night Football game or changing that light fixture that I have been meaning to.

Jim Rohn once said **“success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced every day”** My success comes because I am eager to learn something new every day and put the time aside to do so. 

Thanks,
Chris
