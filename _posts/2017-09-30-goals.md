### What are my goals as a frontend developer? 

I feel almost too green to make a long term goals as a front end developer. I would say my first goal is to complete the Bloc program and learn everything that I can to become a successful developer. After that its quite simple, my goal is to become a front end developer and eventually a full stack developer.

Along this process of becoming a frontend developer I intend to learn as much as I can and as many languages that I can to be as valuable as I can to a future company.
